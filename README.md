# projectTracker
Application to log and keep track of project status

In the project folder run npm install
Next, inside of package.json, change your '--dbpath' to wherever you want to store your mongodb data and backup
Assuming you have everything installed, you can start the program from the terminal or command prompt using:

npm run db
